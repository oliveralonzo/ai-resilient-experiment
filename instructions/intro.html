    <p class="mb-4">In this activity, you will review different visual versions of the same paragraph that have been
        edited to support skimming. The paragraphs will have some visual changes to emphasize which parts to read.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Throughout the activity, you will see two types of visual changes:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Binary</strong>: In the second part of the activity, we will show you "binary" options. Binary means
            that text will either be emphasized or not. To skim, you can read only the emphasized parts to get the main
            content.</li>
        <li><strong>Gradient</strong>: In the second part of the activity, we will show you "gradient" options. Gradient
            means that there will be different levels of emphasis. So, the changes will vary and you can choose to read
            the most emphasized parts.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-4">At each step, youâ€™ll see four versions of the same paragraph, each with different visual changes for
        emphasis. The goal of the visual changes is to support you in reading the emphasized text, effectively skimming.
        <strong>Your task is to select which visual change you prefer the most for skimming (Most Preferred) and which
            one you least prefer (Least Preferred).</strong></p>
