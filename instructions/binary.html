    <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Binary</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">We will begin with the <strong>binary options</strong>. In these options, the text is either
        emphasized or not. To skim, you can just read the emphasized text. Click on each image to enlarge it and read
        the paragraph.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">As a reminder, in each round, youâ€™ll see four versions of the same paragraph, each with different
        visual changes. There are 15 rounds of binary options. For each round, select your most and least preferred
        visual change for skimming, and click Next to continue.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Note:</strong> Once you click Next, you will not be able to go back.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><em>If your internet connection is interrupted or the page refreshes, you can start over.</em></p>

    <p class="mb-4">Please let us know if you have any questions now or throughout. Ready to begin?</p>
